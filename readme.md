# Express Review Exercise

## Folder Structure

- There is a `models` directory and inside that folder is a file called `todos.js` that is supposed to act like a database for our routes to use. There are various methods inside `todos.js` that you need to complete in order for your routes to work. **In order to find out how those methods are supposed to be implemented, check the `model.js` file inside the `test` directory**.
- Routes are in the `routes` director inside the `index.js` file. **In order to find out how to implement the routes, check the `routes.js` file inside the `test` directory**.

## Starting

1. `npm install`
2. You can run `npm test` which will continuously run the test

These tests include [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).
